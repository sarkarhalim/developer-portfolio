            <h1>Dream Big</h1>
            <h2>Become a Doctor</h2>
            <p>When I was a young kid in elementary I use to think I could get away with anything. I would try and set
                pranks on my other classmates and teachers and I use to be a menace at home. I can recall a time when I
                was at home when I was trying to pull a prank on my mother. I was going to try and take her makeup away
                from her when she was getting ready for work so that she would be a little late. All of her makeup was
                at the sink in her bathroom so when she stepped away I was going to make my move. When she left I tried
                to moved in quietly to grab her makeup away. Just as I was going to grab her lipstick from her makeup
                kit she grabbed my arm and said. "You aren't sneaking up on anyone. I saw you the whole time! You are
                always being watched." When I got caught I thought it was just funny at first and I just had to change
                my strategy. But when I sat back and analyzed what she said, is she right? Are we being watched all the
                time and who is watching? Or maybe it can just be crazy mom talk.</p>
