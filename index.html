            <h1>Dream Big</h1>
            <h3 class="tagline">Become a Doctor</h3>
            <p>When I was a young kid in elementary I use to think I could get away with anything. I would try and set
                pranks on my other classmates and teachers and I use to be a menace at home. I can recall a time when I
                was at home when I was trying to pull a prank on my mother. I was going to try and take her makeup away
                from her when she was getting ready for work so that she would be a little late. All of her makeup was
                at the sink in her bathroom so when she stepped away I was going to make my move. When she left I tried
                to moved in quietly to grab her makeup away. Just as I was going to grab her lipstick from her makeup
                kit she grabbed my arm and said. "You aren't sneaking up on anyone. I saw you the whole time! You are
                always being watched." When I got caught I thought it was just funny at first and I just had to change
                my strategy. But when I sat back and analyzed what she said, is she right? Are we being watched all the
                time and who is watching? Or maybe it can just be crazy mom talk.</p>

                <h2 class="tagline">2021-present I Pro level developer</h2>
                <p>A full stack developer can be described as someone with an adept level of knowledge regarding each
                    distinct layer of web development, possessing a passion for software technology. The layers of web
                    development include; an understanding in the server, network and hosting environment, data
                    modelling,
                    business logic, mastery in user interface and user experience, as well as a grasp on what both the
                    consumer and the business need. Full stack developers are extremely valuable to a team as they are
                    able
                    to address, discuss and advise about all ends of the web development process. Developers who can
                    readily
                    assess how a website should look and feel, as well as understanding the potential technical
                    limitations,
                    are a hugely valuable asset.</p>

                <p>Ever since the mobile platform emerged, the web platform started fading into the background of the
                    playing field. The mobile platform is just too foreign, too shiny, and too personally connected to
                    consumers and businesses, the web platform became a must but also a commodity. Because of that, new
                    technology evolved in this area. Developing a full-fledged web platform (not only just a static
                    website
                    but a web application as well) became easier and cheaper to all kinds of businesses. Hence, every
                    small
                    business is able to hire in-house developers to implement and run its web platform.</p>
